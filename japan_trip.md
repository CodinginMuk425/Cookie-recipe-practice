## About
This coming April, I will be travelling to Japan for 14 days with a tour group of young individuals looking to explore the otherside of the world. On my adventure, I will be visiting 6 different cities, experiencing the culture, food, and enjoying the company of 20+ peers of similar age. One of my **favorite** things I am looking forward to doing is fully immersing myself if the Japanese cuisine. On our trip we will be visiting:
* Tokyo
* Hakone (Mt. Fuji)
* Hiroshima
* Kyoto
* Mount Koya (Nara)
* Osaka
## Things I want to do
During my trip, I plan on **fully** immersing myself in the Japanese experience. Because this list is so large and I cannot list every little thing, I have included the top 5 things I would like to expierence with my visit.
1. Eat and learn how to make sushi
2. Do the Robot Cabaret Show and Dinner
3. Eat gallons of Ramen
4. Check out all the amazing temples and scenery
5. Say hello to the bowing deer of Nara

## Final Thoughts
This has been one of my greatest dream vacation destinations. While I am extremely nervous for the journey ahead, I couldn't be more excited. I plan to make this trip on of the best imaginable and want to document my journey so I can enjoy my expierence years to come.
